<h1>Kristina Phillips' Biography</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Kristina Phillips and I am currently seeking my MS in Civil Engineering.  I got my BS in Civil Engineering from Iowa State University in May 2021 and currently work full-time in consulting in the Transportation and Traffic Engineering industry. I was raised in the military and have lived in many states and regions.  I have a husband and children and spend a lot of my time on the ballfield through the spring/summer and in the gym all winter watching basketball.  I enjoy hanging out with friends, traveling, and eating all the best and most interesting foods around. </p>
